# Investigate a Dataset: Influence of the nature and wellbeing of a Country in its ecological behaviour

## Introduction 
This project is the final task for part 2 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree. 

The project consists in creating a jupyter notebook to present an analysis on a dataset of my choice. 

## Description

This analysis is based on date extracted from Gapminder, focused on enviromental pollution and what influences it.

The analysis consists of the following indicators:

- C02 Emission (tonnes per person)

- Forest coverage(%)

- Democracy score

- Human Development Index (HDI)

More detailed information about the datasets can be found in the project. 

## Contents
.ipynb file where the analysis has been developed, contains code with Markdown cells from Jupyter Notebook.
.html file output of the .ipynb converted to web version for easy viewing
.csv files with the data used to conduct the analysis

## Pre-requisites
No installation is needed to view the analysis. 
To reproduce the project an installation of Python 3.5 and the following libraries is needed:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv
